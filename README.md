# Image Cartoonizer With OpenCV
OpenCV is a cross-platform library used for Computer Vision. It includes applications like video and image capturing and processing. It is majorly used in image transformation, object detection, face recognition, and many other stunning applications. Let’s head towards giving our pictures some cartoonic effects.

## Prerequisites
•	Python 3.5+

•	OpenCv 2

## Process of converting an image to a cartoon
•	Convert the image to a Grayscale image

•	The Grayscale image is smoothened

•	Extract the edges in the image

•	Form a colour image and mask it with edges

We perform bitwise AND on two images to mask them. Yes, so that’s how we mask edged image on our “BEAUTIFY” image. This creates a beautiful cartoon image with edges and lightened colour of the original image.
